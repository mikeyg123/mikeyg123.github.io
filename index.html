<h3>Calendar Test</h3>
<br>
This is a shared google calendar embedded into another web page:<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;src=11i53nu8joqk7lku2jiqih29m0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%23AB8B00&amp;ctz=Europe%2FLondon" 
	style="border-width:0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br>
<br>
To create this I logged into the google calendar website, make a new calendar, make it public in the settings and 
copy the links into this web-page.<br>
The size and some of the colours can be modified by changing the iframe src link<br>
<br>
<h3>Subscribe to this calendar</h3>
Anyone can <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/k9jjc663n7apcf7pbogbfifjto%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">click here<a/> to subscribe to public events on their phone, computer, outlook etc.<br>
This is a read-only view that should work with any smartphone<br>
<br>
To unsubscribe:<br>
On an iphone go to Settings -> Calendar -> Accounts -> Subscribed Calendars; and delete "WBKA"<br>
Android and other apps will have a similar setting somewhere.<br>
<br>
<h3>To manage events:</h3>
Admins need a google login and then the calendar can be shared with them.<br>
Once this is done they can either use the <a href="https://calendar.google.com">google calendar website</a> or add their google login to their smartphone calendar settings.<br>
Depending on the permission they are given they can view or manage events and control who else has what permission<br>
<br>
I've tested this with apple's calendar app on the iphone and with google's android app and it works pretty well.<br>
The key thing to remember to set the correct calendar name when you create a new event or it just goes into your personal diary.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell there&apos;s no primary owner of a shared calendar. Everyone with &quot;make changes and manage sharing&quot; permission has equal control and can remove other people.<br>  
I expect only a couple of people should have this power to reduce the chance of someone messing it up.<br>
